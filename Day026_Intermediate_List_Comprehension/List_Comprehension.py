# Task 3

# Write your code above ðŸ‘†
print(result)

# Take a look inside file1.txt and file2.txt. They each contain a bunch of numbers, each number on a new line.
# You are going to create a list called result which contains the numbers that are common in both files.
# e.g. if file1.txt contained:
# 1
# 2
# 3
# and file2.txt contained:
# 2
# 3
# 4
# result = [2, 3]
# IMPORTANT: The output should be a list of integers and not strings! Try to use List Comprehension instead of a Loop.

# Example Output
# [3, 6, 5, 33, 12, 7, 42, 13]
